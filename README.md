Mengar Sponge Fractal Challenge!

<05-04-2021>

Created with Processing! With every mouse press, the Mengar Sponge Fractal grows by one generation, creating the next pattern in the cycle! Although it WILL slow your computer down after about the 3rd iteration... be careful!(Keeping the coding challenge READMEs simple, as there's sure to be a lot of them!)
